# PfDA_Assignment

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description
This assignment contains an analysis of the Cars - Purchase Decision Dataset downloaded from www.kaggle.com. The analysis is done by using pandas, numpy and statistical measures in Python. 

## Background
The Cars - Purchase Decision Dataset was created by Gabriel Santello, a Data Scientist. It is made for study purposes based on other datasets with no missing values. It contains the data of 1000 customers who intend to buy a car, considering their annual salaries.

## A list of items in the PfDA_Assignment:
1. Cars-purchase-decision-dataset - downloaded from www.kaggle.com and uploaded to Jupyter Notebook.
2. Analysis of this data using Python as an analysis tool:
    1. Reading the Cars - Purchase Decision Dataset
    2. Summary of the Cars - Purchase Decision Dataset
    3. Data visualisation using different plots
        - histogram
        - seaborn pairplots
        - seaborn histplots
    4. Statistical measures of The Cars - Purchase Decision Dataset using numpy.random
    Statistical Measures are a technique of descriptive analysis used to give a summary of the characteristics of a data set. Measures of central tendency describe some key characteristics of the data set based on the average or middle values, as they describe the centre of the data.

## How to use these:
1. Go to each individual code in Jupyter Notebook (from the top)
2. Sipmly run each individual code one by one and the tables will print in the notebook
3. For visual codes simply run these and plots will show up automatically in the notebook

## How to analyse Data with Python:
1. Ask the right questions
2. Data collection
3. Summarise the Data
4. Analysing the Data using Plots
5. Analysing the Data using Statistics
6. Results interpretation/observation
